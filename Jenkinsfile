// Pipeline for THIS repo only. Triggers and deploys independently of
// infra/backend — doesn't depend on another job having run first.
//
// Runs as a Multibranch Pipeline on the cloud Jenkins (see
// jenkins-cloud/init.groovy.d/jobs.groovy in the infra repo) — every
// branch builds, lints and runs the smoke test, but the actual deploy
// below only fires on 'main' (`when { branch 'main' }`). That's what
// makes BRANCH_NAME available at all; a plain non-multibranch job
// wouldn't have it.
//
// Deploying to Railway requires a Jenkins credential of type "Secret text"
// with id 'railway-token-frontend' (a Railway Project Token, generated
// from the project dashboard -> Settings -> Tokens) and, optionally, the
// RAILWAY_SERVICE variable if the service name doesn't match Railway's
// default. See README.md.

    // uncapped `next build` can spike past what's left after Jenkins'
    // own footprint and take the whole container down with it (OOM-killed,
    // no error of its own, just a dead pipeline — verified live). Capping
    // Node's heap trades that for an ordinary failed build if it's ever
    // not enough, which is a much better failure mode. Harmless locally
    // too, where there's plenty of headroom.
